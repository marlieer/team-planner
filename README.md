## Team Planner

By Marlie Dueck

Team Planner is a simple app which allows the user to create a project requiring specific skills and competencies. The app performs a calculation to determine how good the fit is and suggests the best suited team members to join the project.

### Steps to Create the Project
1. Create a Laravel project using composer

        composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel:^7.0 team-planner
2. Configure Homestead virtual machine for the development environment. Follow the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/homestead) to install Homestead requirements. To start the virtual machine, run the following command:

        vagrant up
3. Create a .env file and set the environment variables in to connect to the database. Also set the APP_NAME and APP_URL variables.

4. If the APP_KEY is not already set, run the following command from within Homestead at the project root:

        php artisan key:generate
